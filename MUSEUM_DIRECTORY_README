                                            A Command Line Interface Application 
                                                by Ana Harris and Andrew Rivera


We have created a CLI application that allows Museum visitors to obtain information about the Artists, pieces of artwork and galleries located in The Flatiron Museum of Art (not a real place, maybe in the future... who knows?)

2.Run 'bundle install' to downloand all the necessary gems
3.Run 'rake db:seed' in order to populate the seed data for the museum
4.Run  'ruby bin/run.rb' to initiate the CLI application
